## Evo Complete Extension Release 0.24

Hey everyone!, we've listened to the feedback we received from the Crossover Extension mod and after careful review we decided to continue supporting the Evo Extension Mod, while Crossover will remain online it's development time and resources will be devoted somewhere else.

In the meantime however we decided to roll back some of the changes we originally had done to Evo Extension to revert most of them back to their BW values, most noticeably we've reverted the weapon behaviors from BroodWar as well as a huge amount of changes to Research times, costs, Health adjustments.
**Do Note that most of these changes come from vanilla BroodWar values**

Besides that a new iteration of the Melee AI is in development since the current one was not tuned for this version of the Mod.

We hope that this update satisfies the players who seek a more authentic experience when playing Starcraft 2 vs BroodWar modes, we will be on the lookout for additional feedback from our Korean Advisors to continue to improve these mods in the future.
