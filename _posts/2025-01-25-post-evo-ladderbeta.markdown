## SC Evo Ladder Mode Beta

Hi everyone!

We've been working real hard on the first update of the year for which we're adding several new models and a sizeable balance update to address some issues we had on the last season, however today i want to go over a deep dive on the upcoming Ladder Mode beta and what we're set to accomplish.

### Introduction to Ladder Mode

For a while now, we've wanted to offer competitive players something to work toward and showcase their knowledge and skill of the game. So to that end, we've been working on the SC: Evo Ladder mode which acts as a replacement to custom game lobbies; allowing players to play against each other to earn MMR and increase their rank.

Within the SC: Evo Ranked Ladder Arcade Map, players looking to start and continue their journey on the ladder will join an Arcade Lobby from which they may select their game type from a Ranked Match or an Unranked practice match. 

We will soon be releasing the SC: Evo Ranked Ladder for Beta Testing, where we will be looking for players to try out the Unranked Game Mode as well as to stress test our UI Systems. At a later date, we will begin the Closed Ranked Beta Test, where a select group of people will be chosen to host, play, and stream the Ranked 1v1 Gamemode. 
For both Beta Tests, more details of the map can be found below, and given time and funding, we'll be looking to expand the available gamemodes once we finish testing several other aspects of the game.

### Unranked Mode

Within the Unranked Gamemode, two players will be able to play one-on-one practice matches. To start a match, players pick their preferred race from both StarCraft 1 and 2; after which they may select up to three maps to choose as their least preferred to play in.

Finally, once both players are ready to start; they can ready up. Before going into a match, both players will get to see which race was picked as well as the map picked by the system.

Upon completing the game, both players can choose to return to the Evo Menu in which they can play another match. Upon either player leaving the game, both players will return to the StarCraft II Main Menu.

Many of the features used in the Ranked Games are shared with the Unranked mode, which is why it is vital for us to test the most important elements of the game, system & UI before fully releasing the Ranked Mode.

### Ranked Mode

{: .note }
Ranked Mode is still in-development and Testers will be given access to try it out early at a later date.

While a few details of the Ranked Mode are still being ironed out before it is rolled out to our testers there's a few things that we can share with everyone.

Similarly to Unranked, players can play one-on-one with the key difference of being able to earn MMR so long as **both** opponents are eligible for MMR changes.

Initially players will have to complete 5 Placement matches which will determine their initial ranking and once complete their MMR will be set displaying the appropriate rank.

While earning MMR the amount earned by the player may vary based on the current Rank Division of their opponent. We will dive into further details about the MMR system for the Ladder at a later date.

### Upcoming Features

We're working overtime to add new features, and continue to polish the Ranked Arcade Map during its Beta Testing Phase, one personal favorite of mine that I hope to implement being Player VS AI matches. Although due to technical issues currently withstanding, we are unable to garauntee its implementation at this time.

Besides that, here are a couple more Features that we would like to work sometime in the future.

- User Profile
The Evo User Profile is a menu meant to display general player data, with our first iteration of the menu to be a Summary of the User's Most Payed Race, along with their Win Rates, Most Played Map, and once implemented along with Ranked Games; the addition of the current Season's stats.
The User Profile's functionality will be expanded depending on player interest as well development over time.

- Additional Unlockable Skins
In the future as we draw closer to completing the remaining models in SC: Evo's art department for Multiplayer and Campaign , we'd also like to continue expanding the skin system, adding new models, User avatars and a few other goodies that can be unlocked by simply playing SC: Evo.

And this is it for now, we're wrapping up Development on the first public technical test of the new SC: Evo Ranked Ladder Arcade Map launcher, **please remember that Ranked mode will not initially be available**. 

We hope to gather as much feedback as possible and squash any bugs with the help of our players, so we can have a smooth release for the Ranked 1v1 Game Mode at a later date.

The Technical Test map for the SC: Evo Ranked Ladder will be made available soon on the Battle.net Arcade for everyone to try out.
