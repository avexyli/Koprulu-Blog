## Evo Complete Extension Update 1.4

Hey everyone we got a minor update to fix some bugs, visual issues as well as add some features and update some visuals. This update does not contain the balance patch coming from the PTR as it has been delayed since it's still undergoing testing, in the meantime this update will fix a couple bugs and adjust some interactions between BroodWar and StarCraft 2 Spells

In this update we've added a couple of new models and effects funded by our Donors, special thanks to @CerberusSC2 for funding the Archon Model also thank you to our recent Donors for funding the new Defiler effects.

*A reminder that you can help us fund development by donating, your donations go toward funding development as well as making new models at a much faster rate.*
