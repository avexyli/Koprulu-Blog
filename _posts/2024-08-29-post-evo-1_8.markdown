## Evo Complete Extension Update 1.8

Hello again, everyone,

Everyone in the team has been quite busy working on several parts of the project and we're excited to show you all the new things we've got going for the upcoming Update 2.0, there is no complete list of everything upcoming but we're working on the Ranked Gamemode as well as the Legacy Campaign, so look out in the future for more news on these projects as we approach their release window.

In the meantime however we have a balance update out of many more to come.

We'd like everyone to know about the StarCraft Evolution League (SEL) an open tournament for anyone who wants to join featuring SC: Evo, we hope for this tournament to help us continue to make balance changes not to mention the potential to see all these amazing games and new interesting strategies being used by participants, as we continue to make new maps they will be added to the SEL map pool as well as the Ranked Mode for SC: Evo.

As always thank you to all our Patreons and Donors for all their help in funding this project, we hope to continue to make more amazing things and deliver the best remake we can deliver.
