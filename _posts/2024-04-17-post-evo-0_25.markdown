## Evo Complete Extension Release 0.25

Hey everyone! We've been listening to the feedback and discussing balance with our advisors and have brought you an additional update to the balance, this is one of many to come in order to make the StarCraft 1 races more competitive.

Among some of the changes we're decreasing the cost of several BroodWar Spells such as the EMP, Ensnare and Disruption Web as well as slightly buffing some of the Units, we'll explain below some of the reasoning behind some of the changes.

We will continue to monitor the balance changes and make adjustments where necessary and we will avoid too many changes at once in order to reduce risk of overtuning the BroodWar races.

***

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Divider_Extension.png)

* Adjusted Several Upgrade costs

_We've adjusted several upgrade costs to help with the increased unit costs for BroodWar players_

* Adjusted several Ability Energy costs

_Several Abilities have had their Energy costs reduced in order to allow BroodWar players to use abilities more frequently_

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-firebat@scbw.png" width="50" height="50">   Firebat / Marine

* Increased Firebat Health from 50 -> 55
* Increased Marine Health from 40 -> 45
* Increased Marine's U-238 Vespene cost from 50 -> 100

_This Terran Infantry change is aimed at allowing Marines to survive at least a baneling attack, as for the Firebats their high gas cost is not worth it compared to the low health and armor they have compared to the Marauder_

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-goliath@scbw.png" width="50" height="50">   Goliath

* Increased Goliath Anti Air Weapon Range from 5 -> 6
* Increased Charon Boosters Range Bonus from 3 -> 4

_This Goliath buff is meant to allow Goliaths to more effectively fight Tempests ans well as Liberators, Guardians have also undergone a change to comply with this Range change._

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-battlecruiser@scbw.png" width="50" height="50">   Battlecruiser

* Increased Battlecruiser Health from 500 -> 550
* Increased Battlecruiser Speed from 1.406 -> 1.875
* Decreased Battlecruiser's Energy cost from 150 -> 125

_With Battlecruisers being notoriously bad in StarCraft 1 we decided to increase some of their stats, while we have several ideas of what stats to change we want to avoid too many changes at once in order not to risk making them overpowered. In the meantime this change should improve their value even slightly._

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-siegetank-sieged@scbw.png" width="50" height="50">   Siege Tank

* Reduced Siege Tank Research Time from 75 -> 60
* Reduced Siege Tank Research Mineral Cost from 150 -> 100
* Increased Siege Tank's Siege Mode Weapon Range from 12 -> 13

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-ghost.png" width="50" height="50">   Ghost

* Increased Ghost Health from 45 -> 55

* Science Vessel's Defensive Matrix can no longer target Enemies
* Increased Valkyrie range by +1

* Reduced High Templar's Hallucination Energy cost from 100 -> 75



![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Divider_Zerg.png)

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-zerg-overlord.png" width="50" height="50">   Overlord

* Increased Overlord Speed from 0.469 -> 0.9414
* Decreased Overlord's Ventral Sacs Mineral and Gas cost from 200 -> 150

_We've adjusted the Overlord speed based on feedback, allowing BroodWar Zerg players to be able to scout enemy bases during the early game in the same way SC2 players can._

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-zerg-larvaex3.png" width="50" height="50">   Larva

* Reduced Larva Spawn delay from 15 -> 12

_The Larva spawn speed has been buffed to help BroodWar players with the unit production rates, we're still looking at feedback for the sweet spot on the delay and we'll continue to monitor games to see if it needs further adjustments_

* Increased Zerg unit Creep Movement Speed multiplier from 1 -> 1.2

_This change has been made to help Zerg players defend early rush strategies like Reapers, the multiplier currently is not higher than StarCraft 2 Zerg but will be monitored for any potential balance issues._

* Increased Guardian's Weapon Range from 8 -> 10
* Decreased Defiler's Dark Swarm Energy cost from 100 -> 75
