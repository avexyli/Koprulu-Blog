Hi, We're Team Koprulu a group of modders working to create the highest quality StarCraft content that we're able to make. We currently have our sights set on recreating the entirety of StarCraft 1 and it's campaigns in the StarCraft 2 Engine.

Our most popular mod at the moment is **SC: Evo Complete** a mod that puts the BroodWar and Starcraft 2 races together, all while making several balance adjustments to put them on an even playing field but keeping the essence and feel of the originals as intact as possible.

You can play this mod on any region on any map by going to the **Custom** Tab on StarCraft 2, select the **Melee** mode, choose any map of your liking and clicking on the **Create with Mod Button**, finally search for the mod named SC: **Evo complete** and enjoy!

At this time we're even including two additional spinoff projects:
* The Legacy mod, a total conversion that completely replaces the sc2 races with their BroodWar counterparts recreating all the original mechanics and unit stats.
* The Crossover Mod a mod that introduces some different balance changes as well as adding new upgrades and units.

Our Campaign offering which is currently under development will include new Units, Abilities, Upgrades, Heroes, a brand new Progression System, Redesigned Missions and Terrains as well as a host of new features and changes to the Campaigns, You can download the Demo in our Mapster Page. 

We'd like for people to join us in our journey as we work to deliver the Ultimate BroodWar Remake.
